- Summary: Data structures are ways to organize and store data for efficient usage. 
They are essential for creating fast algorithms and solving problems effectively.

- Main Types of Data Structures
    - 1. Linear Structures
        * Array: A fixed-size list of elements of the same type. Example: a list of numbers.
        * Linked List: A list where each element points to the next. Useful for insertions and deletions.
        * Stack: Follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. Used in recursion and history tracking.
        * Queue: Follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. Example: customer service queues.

    - 2. Non-Linear Structures
        * Tree: A hierarchical structure with nodes organized into levels. Example: file directories.
        * Graph: A set of points (vertices) connected by lines (edges). Example: social networks.
        * Hash Table: Uses hash functions to store and retrieve data quickly.
        * These structures help solve problems efficiently, such as quick searches, data organization, 
        and network navigation.
